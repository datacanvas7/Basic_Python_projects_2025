    "## Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Random Number Generation**\n",
    "- The `random.randint(1, 100)` function generates a random integer between 1 and 100, which is the target number the user needs to guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Life Count**\n",
    "- The player starts with 3 lives (`lives = 3`).\n",
    "- After each wrong guess, the life count decreases by 1 (`lives -= 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Game Loop**\n",
    "- The game runs in a `while` loop until the user guesses the correct number or runs out of lives.\n",
    "- The user is prompted to enter their guess, and the number of attempts is incremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Binary Search Logic**\n",
    "- If the guess is **less than** the target number, the game hints \"Go higher!\" and deducts one life.\n",
    "- If the guess is **greater than** the target number, the game hints \"Go lower!\" and deducts one life.\n",
    "- This logic mimics the **binary search algorithm**, where the search space is halved with each guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Input Validation**\n",
    "- The `try-except` block ensures the user enters a valid integer. If the input is invalid, the game prompts the user to try again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Winning the Game**\n",
    "- When the user guesses the correct number, the game congratulates them and displays the number of attempts taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Losing the Game**\n",
    "- If the player runs out of lives, the game ends and reveals the correct number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Restart Option**\n",
    "- After finishing a round, the player is asked if they want to play again.\n",
    "- If the player chooses \"yes\", the game restarts with a new random number.\n",
    "- If the player chooses \"no\", the game ends."

    "### **Future Enhancements**\n",
    "1. **Difficulty Levels**: Add different difficulty levels (e.g., smaller or larger ranges).\n",
    "2. **Score System**: Implement a scoring system based on the number of attempts and remaining lives.\n",
    "3. **GUI**: Create a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like `tkinter` or `PyQt`.\n",
    "4. **Multiplayer Mode**: Allow two players to compete against each other.\n",
